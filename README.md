# Memory Game

## How The Game Works

The game board consists of sixteen "cards" arranged in a grid. The deck is made up of eight different pairs of cards, each with different symbols on one side. The cards are arranged randomly on the grid with the symbol face down. The gameplay rules are very simple: flip over two hidden cards at a time to locate the ones that match!

Each turn:

The player flips one card over to reveal its underlying symbol.
The player then turns over a second card, trying to find the corresponding card with the same symbol.
If the cards match, both cards stay flipped over.
If the cards do not match, both cards are flipped face down.
The game ends once all cards have been correctly matched.

## Game Functionality

The real-life game, players flip over cards to locate the pairs that match The goal is to recreate this effect in your project. There are a couple of interactions:

A. The flipping cards match
  The matched card will be on locked down position.

B. The flipping cards don't match
  The card will go back to face down position. At this point the memory part of the game will come to picture. The player has to remember the card and their position and try to find a match.
  
C. Game over
  Game will be over when all 8 cards has their match locked down.
